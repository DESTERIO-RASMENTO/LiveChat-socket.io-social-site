## Verify Installation

- Open a command prompt (or PowerShell), and enter the following
```
    node -v
    
```
- The system should display the Node.js version installed on your system. You can do the same for NPM:

```
    npm -v
    
```

- To check MongoDB Server version, Open the command line via your terminal program and execute the following command:

```
    mongod --version
    
```
- To Check MongoDB Shell version, Type:

```
    mongo
    
```

- On windows you will have to use full path to the mongod.exe and mongo.exe to check mongodb version, if you have not set MongoDB Path.
- But if MongoDb Path is being set, you can simply use the mongod and mongo command.
